efal_sample

This sample C++ application demonstrates the use of EFAL to create and populate a table.
Included here are examples of the following:
•	create a set of strongly typed variables for the data 
•	create an executable statement, e.g., Insert, which includes binding points for the variables 
•	set the value of the variables 
•	execute the statement 
o	continue to (re) set the value of the variables and (re) execute the statement

The sample also includes geometry.cpp, which demonstrates reading and writing Geopackage binary format geometries.
